# Standing Committees and Working Groups

## Overview

In addition to the software work on Jupyter that is coordinated through the [Software Steering Council](software_steering_council.md) (SSC), much of the projectâ€™s work expands beyond software. Examples include code of conduct incident response, diversity and inclusion, operations, legal, fundraising, events, community, and marketing. Standing Committees and Working Groups carry out this non-software related work of the project by delegation from the [Executive Council](executive_council).

The primary difference between Standing Committees and Working Groups is that Standing Committees are intended to be permanent; they are only created and dissolved by a joint vote of the EC and SSC. In contrast, Working Groups can be created and dissolved by the EC acting alone.

A list of Standing Committees and Working Groups can be [found here](list_of_standing_committees_and_working_groups.md).

## Common Points

Standing Committees and Working Groups both:

- Have a well-defined council which makes decisions using the [Jupyter Decision-Making Guide](decision_making.md).
- Follow the council appointment process outlined in their charter.
- Are managed by, report to, and are accountable to the [Executive Council](executive_council).
- Have charters that define their scope and purpose. Within those charters, they are free to make decisions autonomously.
- Carry out their functions in a manner that is as open and transparent as possible given the unique dimensions of their charter.
- Maintain a public GitHub repository with basic information (council members, charter, public meetings, SSC representative, etc.) for purposes of transparency and consistency.

## Standing Committees

Standing Committees have the following unique properties:

- Standing Committees focus on areas critical to the governance of the project and thus are established and dissolved by joint decisions of the SSC and EC.
- Changes to the charters of Standing Committees are approved by joint decisions of the SSC and EC.
- Standing Committees always have a representative on the SSC, elected by the Standing Committee Council.
- The EC is responsible for ensuring the Standing Committees are appropriately resourced at all times.

## Working Groups

Working Groups have the following unique properties:

- Working Groups are established and dissolved by decisions of EC.
- Changes to the charters of Working Groups are approved by the EC.
- Working Groups, by default, do not have representatives on the SSC.
- Optionally, the EC may nominate certain Working Groups to have a representative on the SSC. Once approved by the SSC to have a representative on the SSC, Working Group councils elect and maintain their representative to the SSC using the Decision-Making Guide.
