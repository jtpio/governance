# Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee Charter

Project Jupyter welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and learning. We work together as a community to help each other live out these values.

The Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Committee is a standing committee established under Jupyterâ€™s governance model. The committee reviews its charter annually and may make changes at any time during the year. Substantive changes to the purpose or mission must be submitted to the Executive Council (EC) and the Software Steering Council (SSC) for approval.

## Purpose 

The purpose of this committee is to lead strategic initiatives designed to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion of Project Jupyter community leaders, contributors, and end users across the globe. For the long-term sustainability of our community, we champion efforts to build an open source environment where people feel respected, valued, and encouraged to continue participating. The DEI group impacts all Jupyter forums, including but not limited to software, working groups, standing committees, JupyterCon, social media, GitHub, the EC, and the SSC.

## Mission/Areas of Responsibility

The DEI standing committee is responsible for: 
* Propose, execute, and evaluate the impact of DEI initiatives
* Research, establish, and collect metrics related to DEI
* Advocate for increased participation of underrepresented groups in the Jupyter community.
