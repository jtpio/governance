# Community Building Working Group

The Jupyter Community Building Working Group (JCB) acts on behalf of the Project
Jupyter Executive Council with the objective of growing, building, and
connecting the Jupyter community of users and contributors. A targeted outcome
of this working group's efforts is to improve the diversity, equity, and
inclusion of our community, in collaboration with the Jupyter Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion (DEI) standing committee.

The current members of the Jupyter Community Building Working Group are listed in the [Leadership Directory](people).

## Areas of responsibility

### Jupyter Community Workshops

The Jupyter Community Workshop program was established in 2018 to bring
together small groups of Jupyter community members and core contributors for
high-impact strategic work and community engagement on focused topics. These
in-person events are particularly useful for tackling challenging development
and design projects, growing the community of contributors, and strengthening
collaborations.

This working group will partner with NumFOCUS to manage the Jupyter Community
Workshop program operations and budget.

### JupyterCon

Global JupyterCon conferences provide opportunities for the Jupyter community
to come together to learn and share.

This working group will drive the strategic direction and broad operational
aspects of JupyterCon, including the partnership with NumFOCUS and the
community leadership for the event.

### Jupyter Community Events Staff

This working group will be responsible for the relationship with professional
staff (for example, at NumFOCUS) planning Jupyter events, such as community
workshops and JupyterCon.

### Operations and Budget

This working group will collaborate with NumFOCUS to serve as stewards and
decision-makers to allocate the Project Jupyter funds currently associated
with Jupyter community building at NumFOCUS, including donations and revenue
from Jupyter Community Workshops and JupyterCon.

### Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

Project Jupyter is an engaged and respectful community made up of people from
all over the world. This working group pledges to foster a productive,
harassment-free environment for everyone who participates in organizing or
attending our events. We recognize our work is a highly visible and
potentially impactful way for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts
to be championed within our global community.

In particular, this working group will:

- Collaborate with the Jupyter Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
  standing committee to find new ways to make a positive impact in
  Project Jupyter.
- Partner with the DEI standing committee to train and mentor community event
  leadership in DEI efforts for their events.
- Help the DEI standing committee measure impact of DEI efforts in Jupyter events where feasible.

## Reporting

This working group will report to the Executive Council quarterly on all areas of
responsibility, including activities, finances, and DEI efforts. This
working group will also publish an annual blog post for the broader global
community.

## Membership

Members of this working group will be elected by the existing working group
following the Jupyter guidelines for forming and perpetuating a decision-making
body, subject to approval by the Executive Council.
